## **Project Introduction**

Pancreatic cancer is known as the "king of cancer" due to its high malignancy and poor prognosis. The current treatment is not effective, and the survival rate has not improved significantly in the past 10 years.(1) Pancreatic cancer is often surrounded by a large number of fibers, and the internal microenvironment is characterized by hypoxia and high lactic acid.(2, 3) Therefore, bacteria with high affinity for this microenvironment are considered to have potential for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.(4) To ensure safety and efficacy, it is necessary to finely regulate the survival of bacteria so that they can colonize tumors specifically before being eliminated by the immune system. In addition, precision radiotherapy can significantly reduce the damage to normal tissues and improve the survival rate of patients. However, the high cost of PET/CT examination is often difficult for patients to accept. In summary, our team planned to construct a AND gate system (hypoxia and high lactate) in E. coli to improve the targeting of pancreatic cancer. At the same time, it was transferred to an acoustic reporting system to generate ultrasound detectable vesicles to track the metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and combined with precision radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
