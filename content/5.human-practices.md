## **Introduction**

Peking iGEM 2023 team's project is a specially designed bacterial therapy for pancreatic cancer. We note that pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early, has fewer drug options, and has a low five-year survival rate. To better understand the current status of pancreatic cancer treatment and the problems that need to be solved, we have communicated with physicians, medical journal editors, and pancreatic cancer patients.

In interviews with doctors and editors, we learned that the current surgical resection of pancreatic cancer is very difficult, the treatment effect of traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy is not good, and there are few drugs to choose from. Also, based on the characteristics of pancreatic cancer, the rapid development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in recent years is not good enough for its treatment. The above interviews made us fully realize the difficulty in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that a new treatment approach is needed for pancreatic cancer. Based on the current situation, Peking 2023 proposed an intelligent bacterial therapy for pancreatic cancer, which is expected to play a role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

In communication with pancreatic cancer patients, we fully understand the psychological activities of patients and their living conditions. In the interview, we learned that most patients are worried and anxious when they know they are sick, and it is difficult to regain the courage to live. However, attitude is one of the key factors in cancer treatment, and studies have shown that patients who have a positive attitude about the future do far better than those who have a negative attitude under the same treatment plan. In summary, we believe that the advancement of pancreatic cancer treatment requires the joint development of treatment programs and psychological education. We understand contemporary Chinese citizens' views on life and death through a questionnaire survey and find that the vast majority of people hold a negative attitude towards death, which may be influenced by the taboo of death in traditional Chinese culture. At the same time, the vast majority of people believe that the death education they have received in the past is not enough, and the future needs to popularize the philosophy of life and death. Based on the current situation, Peking 2023 conducted interviews with medical students and university professors and added life-and-death education to its publicity and education for high school students and other social groups. We hope that with our efforts, the importance of life and death education can be paid attention to, and the concept of life of citizens can be improved.

Peking 2023 is also actively involved in cooperation and development in the field of synthetic biology. In July this year, we participated in the China iGEM Team Exchange meeting held in Haikou to communicate with other iGEM teams in China. In August this year, we participated in the second China Synthetic Biology Conference in Ningbo, where we exchanged views on the future development of synthetic biology with biology professors and practitioners in biological enterprises. At the same time, we have hosted many offline events and actively cooperated with other iGEM teams in the Beijing area. In the future, Peking 2023 will continue to deepen cooperation with all sectors of society and commit itself to the development of synthetic biology in China.

## **MEDICAL TREATMENTS**

### ——r.Zhou Yu's views on individualized comprehensive diagnosis

 

r. Zhou Yu is a doctor in the Pancreas Center of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. He is proficient in minimally invasive techniques for common pancreatic, biliary tract, and liver surgical diseases. Also, he has more experience in individualized comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor surgery.

Q: Hello, Doctor Zhou! I understand you are a surgeon who mainly treats the lesion by minimally invasive resection. Before we came, we knew that because of the importance of viscera, pancreatic surgery can be very difficult. In your opinion, compared with other abdominal tumor operations, what special points or difficulties should be paid attention to in the operation of pancreatic cancer?

A: First of all, the pancreas is in a special place. It has a lot of blood vessels around it, such as the superior mesenteric artery, the superior mesenteric vein, and some very important vessels like the celiac trunk. So what makes pancreatic cancer different from other tumors is that it has to deal with a lot of blood vessels during surgery, which is more difficult.

Secondly, pancreatic cancer surgery itself is quite difficult. The most difficult pancreaticoduodenectomy is to remove part of the stomach, all of the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, and the biliary and extrahepatic bile ducts. Postoperative reconstruction involves three sites. It is necessary to reconstruct the stomach and intestine, the stump of the pancreas and the intestine, and the bile duct and the intestine. This is the only one of all the conventional abdominal surgical procedures that has to be done with three anastomoses. At the same time on some of the anastomosis, the demand is higher. If improper fit, the phenomenon of pancreatic leakage is quite a tough complication.

Third, surgery for pancreatic cancer is very demanding, and it is necessary to remove the lesion as completely as possible. ) must be R0 resection and lymph node cleaning to do specification, and retroperitoneum parts of the related area must be cleaned, especially the blood vessels to do bone mineralization. In conclusion, completing a high-quality pancreatic cancer surgery is very difficult.



Q: How many patients with pancreatic cancer can undergo surgery in clinical treatment?

 A: Due to the highly malignant biological behavior of pancreatic cancer, about 50% of patients have been diagnosed with distant organ metastasis, and about 30% of patients have peripancreatic vascular invasion, which is characterized as local progression. The cancer tissues of the above two types of patients are considered to be unresectable. Only about 20% of patients had resectable tumors on imaging.

 

Q: Could you give us a general overview of the non-surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer?

A: Chemotherapy is the main non-surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer, but the drugs for chemotherapy are also limited. For pancreatic cancer in the 90s began to use 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic drug, and then after 2010, gemcitabine appeared, during this period there was not too much progress. Newer therapies, such as mFOLFIRINOX and albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, are only now becoming available. However, the curative effect of chemotherapy is limited and has great side effects.

The emerging therapies for cancer, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, also have a poor treatment effect on pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and immunotherapy alone mostly fails. Although there are some targeted drugs for pancreatic cancer, such as Palbociclib and Olaparib, a single regimen often leads to failure due to the complex histological features and high tumor heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer itself.

 

Q: Finally, can you share your thoughts on the future of pancreatic cancer treatment?

A: I think that surgery may reach the end. Although the treatment effect of the current new therapies is not good, the breakthrough of the efficacy in the future may still require the emergence of new treatment methods or new drugs.



### PATIENTs

### ——Meilu‘s sharing her own exprience

Mei Lu (not her real name) is a pancreatic cancer patient whose journey against cancer began in May 2022 when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent open surgery. Then, the first round of chemotherapy was started in June, and the third round was completed in August to prepare for the fourth round of treatment. In this arduous anti-cancer process, Miss Mei Lu shared an important point with us: Cancer itself is not terrible, terrible is afraid to face up to it, and choose to give up. She told us how she got over the early collapse and crying, adjusted her mentality, faced the reality, and met the challenge. 

The process of chemotherapy is very painful, and everyone's physical fitness and the amount of medicine used will lead to different degrees of side effects. Mei Lu had an acute drug reaction, and she had nausea and vomiting on the day of chemotherapy. However, she will be given an antiemetic to help her feel better. She told us, "Every time I take my medicine and vomit, I just go to sleep. The next day, my body will react slightly and I will be able to start eating normally and gradually increase the amount of food I eat." Through three rounds of chemotherapy, her white blood cells and red blood cells have fluctuated around the lowest normal range, but other measures are okay. However, the process caused her to lose 10 pounds in three months. This is Miss Mei Lu's real experience of chemotherapy. Although it was full of pain and hardship, she insisted on it with her strength and bravery. 

She also experienced some degree of hair loss. She told us that some straight hair will naturally curl, while some white hair will darken. She has also lost more than half of her hair, but fortunately, she has not yet developed a noticeable baldness. Looking at the photo of Miss Mei Lu at that time, she smiled brightly, but in fact, she was wearing a piece of wig. She shared with us, wearing a wig looks very natural. 

Miss Mei Lu also tried the treatment of Chinese medicine, and she shared her experience with us. After many people take Chinese medicine, the pain will be relieved. Some people will experience poor appetite, and they will be improved after taking Chinese medicine." Miss Mei Lu said that after she tried traditional Chinese medicine treatment, her complexion improved significantly, and her appetite also gradually improved. She lasted for more than half a year of traditional Chinese medicine treatment, and now she is also receiving treatment in a hospital of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. "After taking Chinese medicine, the first is to look good, then, is to eat what appetite is good, so I probably ate also has half a year." "Said Miss Mei Lu 

In her sharing, she mentioned that pancreatic cancer patients have established a small group, and information is shared. Sharing in the group, we found that most patients with pancreatic cancer have entered the middle and late stages. One of the patients who continued chemotherapy in Beijing also insisted on it for nearly two years, but also was in poor condition due to the harm of the treatment. Some people have experienced chemotherapy treatment, although there is an obvious improvement at the beginning, but they will soon relapse, or appear obvious discomfort and deterioration in the body. Miss Mei Lu said regretfully that the current chemotherapy method is still too harmful to the body.

Miss Mei Lu's story moved us deeply. Her strength and positive attitude allowed her to face her cancer and draw strength from it to move on. Her experience tells us that in the face of difficulties and challenges in life, we cannot choose to escape and give up, but we should face them bravely and stick to them. "After getting cancer, our biggest lesson is to be grateful! People's life to experience a variety of difficulties, compared with those natural disasters, we can now timely correct their bad living and eating habits, start again, and thank God for giving us a chance to live again. At the same time, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement." It is not difficult to see that Miss Mei Lu has been very positive on the road to cancer, she said: "No matter how long the days ahead, take it one day at a time, we want to leave our children and family the best gift is our optimism and strong!" At the same time, as a patient with pancreatic cancer, she also expressed her expectations for our team and young students. Mei Lu sincerely said to us that "now we need these high-end talents". This gives us the motivation to persist in the development of new treatments for pancreatic cancer.

Finally, we would like to express our respects and blessings to Miss Mei Lu. Her brave and optimistic attitude is worth learning from. I hope she can keep a strong mind, overcome the disease, and recover soon.



## **PUBLIC AWAERENESS**

### Magazine

### ——Editor of China Cancer Prevention and Treatment Journal

Recently, the representative was honored to interview China Cancer Prevention Magazine. We were impressed by the magazine's tenet of "prevention as the primary and simultaneous prevention and control". The journal has been committed to epidemiology and preventive medicine, basic research, clinical research, reviews and lectures, technological innovation and experience exchange, abstract and case reports, information reprinting of tumor research outside the region, newsletters and other work. At the same time, the journal mainly serves the basic cancer research and clinical workers and college teachers and students. Our team is currently working on pancreatic cancer research, hoping to complete the construction of pancreatic cancer targeting engineering bacteria in this year's competition. In the course of the study, we communicated with the editors of China Cancer Prevention and Treatment Journal and got their strong support and help.

Through consulting clinical guidelines and epidemiological data, we learned that although the prevention and treatment methods of various tumors continue to improve, the five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer has been maintained at about 10% in the past decade, and there has been no change. The review article also noted that "the situation is depressing." Therefore, we asked the relevant staff of China Cancer Prevention and Treatment Journal about the current situation of pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment and the reasons for this situation. We also asked if the journal would be interested in publishing articles related to emerging therapies for pancreatic cancer, such as our research on bacteria-targeted tumor therapies, to explore future collaboration opportunities. The editors told us that the magazine does not have much coverage of pancreatic cancer, only 31 articles in the last five years. A new report shows that the trend of pancreatic cancer death among people aged ≥20 years in China continues to rise, especially in urban areas where the increase in mortality is higher than in rural areas, and men are higher than women. The projections also indicate that pancreatic cancer deaths will continue to rise over the next 20 years. The journal, which shared the original article with us, says there hasn't been much coverage of "bacteria-targeting" research, and if we have meaningful results, they'll be happy to publish them.

We also asked the editor about the magazine's audience group, and wanted to know whether there were other means of new media publicity besides paper magazines and online magazines, and to know its publicity effect. The editor informed us that the journal was a professional academic journal of oncology, not a popular science journal for the general public, so there was no relevant popular science publicity.

By interacting with the editors and reading the literature they shared with us, we have gained a better understanding of the current state of pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment and the urgent need for education. We are looking forward to publishing an article on new therapies for pancreatic cancer in the Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Control, and hope to further cooperate with the journal in the future.

### Sociology STUDENTs 

### ——The Complexity of Life and Death Decisions: Reflections from an In-depth Interview

On August 1, I ,on behalf of our team, conducted an interview with Yan Fu's classmates about life and death decisions. The interview was triggered by a choice made by a terminal facial patient. The focus of the discussion is whether, when faced with the prospect of a cure, we should hope for a cure and accept painful treatment, or choose to forgo treatment and complete the regrets of life. This topic has led to long discussions and deep thinking.

The students gave their personal thoughts from their own perspectives. They deeply understand that when faced with life and death decisions, we need to consider not only our own wishes, the probability of healing and the pain of treatment, but also the psychology of the family and the feelings of those around us. There are many unfinished regrets behind life and death decisions, which may include accompanying someone or a group of people along the way. Students also realized that at different ages, people have different ideas about life and death, and whether they have expectations for the life they have not yet enjoyed is an important question.

Next, students thought about how to face the threat of cancer in the family and how to educate children to understand and think about this issue. They point to a plot in a movie in which a father tries to explain to his family's children why the elderly grandfather of a cancer patient suddenly appears in the family, only to die suddenly. There is also a deep discussion on the attitudes of people of different ages towards death shown in the TV series The Smart Doctor. Students thought about children suffering from a change of medication, elderly people who are unable to express their wishes, and whether they should continue to receive treatment or face death. In addition, a plot in the film Amour was mentioned, in which an elderly but always elegant wife loses the ability to take care of herself due to a stroke. Is this an oppression of her dignity? The choice between life and death was once difficult and important.

At the end of the interview, the interviewer shared with the students the first production of the second season of the classic Broadway mystery trilogy, "Pillowman." A line in the play, "Loving you is the only reason to kill you," makes everyone feel confused and chilled. This raises the question of whether suicide can be prevented by ordering a child to die in early childhood because of the pain they know they will experience in the future. The students agreed that the future pain in "Pillow Man" is multi-dimensional, because the face is a child, so it will not be monotonous. Therefore, we should not deprive ourselves of this rich and diverse future. In this interview, the students have expressed their ideas of life and death and attitudes towards life and death education, so that we have gained a lot on this topic.

In summary, through this interview, we delve into the complexities and issues raised by life and death decisions, and gain from different perspectives and experience sharing. This is certainly a thought-provoking topic that must be treated in a professional, rational and respectful manner.

## **FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS**

### Department of Pharmacy Administration

Yang Zhao is a teacher in the Department of Pharmacy Administration at Peking University Health Science Center. In the interview with Mr. Yang Zhao, we were fortunate to hear his in-depth insights on the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and the approval of drug management. Professor Yang first shared the innovation in the field of pancreatic cancer treatment and solutions in different fields. He mentioned that in recent years, innovative research on the treatment of pancreatic cancer has emerged in the field of medical biology, including immunotherapy, targeted therapy, gene therapy, etc. These new treatments offer hope for patients with pancreatic cancer. At the same time, he also mentioned solutions to the treatment of pancreatic miscancer in different fields, such as in the field of medical imaging. The application of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound guidance technology makes the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer more accurate and reliable. 

Professor Yang emphasized that tumor, as a hot topic, not only has received extensive attention in the academic community but also has become a key research object in the field of drug research and development. He mentioned CAR-T cell therapy as an innovative cancer treatment method, which has achieved remarkable results; At the same time, he also mentioned some other innovative ideas, such as the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the study of tumor metastasis. The proposal and application of these innovative ideas have brought great help to the breakthrough of tumor problems. 

As an expert in pharmacy, Yang introduced us to all aspects of drug development and selection. He told us that even if the drugs are being developed to target the same cancer, different animal models can make a huge difference. This is important because changes from small animal models in the laboratory to life-saving treatments in hospitals require consideration of the complexity and variability of the human body. He gives an example of how animal size affects drug development. The body size and physiological characteristics of different animals will directly affect the metabolism and efficacy of drugs, so more attention should be paid to the accuracy and reliability of models in the process of drug development.

Professor Yang reminded us that in the early stage of the project, we should pay more attention to the improvement of the fundamental research. He emphasized the importance of fundamental research, including drug development, experimental design, and data analysis. Only after the fundamental research is improved, can we better promote the development of the project. In addition, he addressed the issue of how to elevate the model level to the human body level. He believes that this question is particularly important in the field of pharmaceutics. He suggested that we refine and improve our project under the guidance of professional teachers. By cooperating with professional teachers, we can make full use of their experience and expertise to further improve the level of our research. 

In the stage of drug administration and approval, Yang told us that we could cooperate with professional drug companies for program design. At this stage, the R&D team doesn't need to worry too much, and the core work is still perfecting the technology. He pointed out that drug administration approval is a complex and cumbersome process that needs professional companies to complete. As R&D personnel, we need to focus on the improvement of technology and cooperate with professional companies to jointly promote the development of projects. 

Through the interview with Mr. Yang, we deeply realized the importance of the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and the approval of drug administration. His insights and experience have played an essential role in guiding us. We will keep his advice in mind and focus on refining the fundamental research in the project while focusing on advancing the experimental results to the human level. In terms of follow-up research and development, we can seek the help of professional teachers to make progress in the safety and effectiveness of our program. Finally, in the pharmaceutical approval stage, we will actively cooperate with professional companies to jointly design programs, so that the research and development team can focus on technical improvement.

Professor Yang's explanation made us deeply realize the importance of diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and drug administration approval and also had a clearer understanding of our project development. We believe in our joint efforts, our project will be able to help bring hope to patients with pancreatic cancer.



### Synthetic biology industry development and product regulation

Synthetic biology is a booming field of science with exciting prospects. Recently, however, synthetic biology has seen an inevitable decline. Yang's presentation noted that synthetic biology peaked in 2021, with global investment in synthetic biology startups reaching nearly $21.8 billion. However, starting in 2022, the number began to decline. Especially in terms of financing, mainly B round and angel round.

Although the development of synthetic biology is declining in the world, the field of synthetic biology in our country is thriving. According to statistics, our country occupies 25% of the global synthetic biology enterprises. Yang Chen divides these enterprises into two layers: the basic layer and the application layer. It can be seen that China is characterized by a relatively large number of application layers, while the basic layer takes laboratory automation and DNA as the main research direction.

In conjunction with the December 2020 EB Insight report, Yang also summarized the rough consensus on biotech development. In the process of the development of biotechnology from traditional to modern and then to modern, its enabling ability has also undergone great changes. We paid more attention to natural products in the past and evaluated the safety and efficacy of the drug. Now we begin to pay close attention to the application of techniques and tools, and the problems and challenges. These issues include not only efficacy, safety, and consistency evaluation, but also the future development, uncertainty, and ability of the technology to be widely used.

However, synthetic biology also faces several challenges. The first is the need for safety screening to prevent potential risks when synthesizing DNA sequences. Second, as a double-edged technology, synthetic biology can both boost industry and potentially raise safety and security issues. Regulators need to formulate policies to address both issues.

Addressing the central question of synthetic biology regulation, we need to think about the scientific skills, expertise, and tools that regulators will need to ensure effective evaluation of future synthetic biotechnology. Government departments and public organizations can set up PreIND New Drug research application meetings to improve the gene therapy product application system.

Overall, the establishment of quality regulation at the product end in terms of natural biosynthesis is necessary. Take the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for example, they conduct evaluation and ethical norms at the process and product level of the drug safety module. For aspects of life transformed by modern biotechnology, such as molecular biology, genomics and systems biology, laboratory safety levels from source to end, pathogenic microorganism classification lists and GM crop approval norms can be formulated. At the same time, joint funding agencies, CDC, environmental protection departments and agricultural departments work together to improve development.

For "designed life" at the level of synthetic biology, it needs to be regulated by combining technical tools and products. This includes the screening of synthetic DNA sequences, policies governing "dual-use" technologies, and the approval of genetic modification for the production of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs). These steps require joint efforts by funding agencies, research institutions, and food and drug safety agencies.

The development of synthetic biology cannot be separated from the support and cooperation of government, enterprises and research institutions. Only by working together will we be able to drive greater breakthroughs in synthetic biology and bring more benefits to human society. In the future, we need to continue to pay attention to technological innovation and development, and actively explore how to make corresponding adjustments in management to ensure the safe and sustainable development of synthetic biology.

 





### YU CHAO

### ——Technological innovation and development trends in the field of health based on synthetic biology

Synthetic biology is an emerging field of science, and its development is closely related to the origin and technological changes of biosynthesis. In surplus over the professor's lecture, he first introduces the origin of biosynthesis and technological changes, and then the reality of synthetic biology applications and prospects for sharing.

Biosynthesis refers to the use of chemical reactions and synthetic processes in living organisms to make useful compounds or products. The concept can be traced back to ancient times when people made wine, bread, and other foods through fermentation and other methods. Over time, chemical reactions and synthetic processes in living organisms have been recognized as having great potential and value. During the Middle Ages, chemistry came into its own, and people began to use chemical methods to make medicines and other compounds. This marked the evolution from natural creation to medieval chemistry. However, traditional chemical methods have many limitations and difficulties that fail to meet the needs for more efficient, precise, and controllable manufacturing processes.

With the progress of science and technology, chemical synthesis has gradually developed into an independent scientific field. By optimizing the reaction conditions, catalysts, and other factors, people can synthesize a greater variety of compounds. However, there are still some problems in traditional chemical synthesis, such as waste generation and environmental pollution. It is in this context that synthetic biology emerged. Professor Yu Chao pointed out that the research idea of synthetic biology is essentially engineering. It emphasizes the realization of logical topologies through standardized design patterns, and ultimately the construction of new devices, new products, and new lives. This kind of engineering thinking of making synthetic biology can play an important role in different fields

In the field of health, synthetic biology has a broad application prospect. Professor Yu Chao introduced the applications in biomedicine, nutrition and health care, medical service, health management, and health care.

In biomedicine, synthetic biology can help develop new drugs and provide personalized treatment options. Through the analysis and regulation of the genome, the precise treatment of diseases can be achieved. In addition, the use of synthetic biology technology can also improve drug yield and purity, and reduce manufacturing costs.

In the field of nutrition and healthcare, synthetic biology can produce healthier and more nutritious food ingredients. By regulating the metabolic pathways of microorganisms, nutrients with specific functions, such as vitamins and amino acids, can be synthesized. This will provide people with more healthy food choices, which will help improve people's dietary patterns and promote health.

In the fields of medical service, health management, and health care, synthetic biology can provide more precise and personalized services. Through the analysis and prediction of individual genomes, health management programs tailored to individual needs can be developed. In addition, more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutics can be developed using synthetic biology techniques.

In particular, in the field of food nutrition, Professor Yu Chao introduced the research on the use of microorganisms to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids by Jiabiyou Biotechnology. Polysaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are important nutrients for human health, but it is difficult to obtain sufficient amounts from traditional foods. Through synthetic biology technology, Gabiyou company has successfully used microorganisms to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids, providing people with healthier and more nutritious food options.

Synthetic biology and health always have a very broad space for development. General health is the direction that people will continue to pursue in the future, and with the help of synthetic biology, we can get a new upgrade. Through engineering thinking and innovative technology, synthetic biology will bring more breakthroughs and innovations to the field of health, and contribute to the health and well-being of human beings.

### zhang xianen

### ——Synthetic biology and biological manufacturing green development in China**

 

Professor Zhang Xian’en first started from China's first bioeconomy development plan in the "14th Five-Year" bioeconomy development Plan. In the key development fields that comply with the four development trends, biomedicine is an important component. It also includes the core issues of our team's concern, original ability, disease prevention and treatment, modern diagnosis and treatment technology and equipment. Also, the professor mentioned that the fifth of the 28 measures in the "14th Five-Year Plan" bioeconomy development Plan focuses on accelerating the improvement of biotechnology innovation ability, promoting the technological innovation of synthetic biology, breaking through the computational design of biological manufacturing strains, and orderly promoting the application in the fields of new drug development, disease treatment, and care.

 

At the same time, for comparison, Professor Zhang Xian’en talked about the US Executive Order to promote Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing, September 12, 2022, Biden: signed an Executive order on advancing biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation for a sustainable, safe, and secure American bioeconomy, emphasizing the importance of developing biotechnology and biological manufacturing.

 

In the context of the development of synthetic biology, from synthetic gene circuit construction in 2000 to quantitative synthetic biology in 2019 and synthetic biology competition in 2022, synthetic biology has developed rapidly in enabling technology and theoretical innovation. At the same time, the special topic of synthetic biology in China's National 973 program, Both the 13th and 14th Five-Year Plans show the position and importance of synthetic biology.

 

Then, the professor introduced the development priorities of synthetic biology until 2030, the core of which is the combination of artificial intelligence and quantitative biology, and then the development of cell-free systems, multicellular systems, gene circuits, and gene technology. In recent years, drug research and development has become the hot spot in synthetic biology. Also provides information for Peking 2023 research and development of pancreatic cancer treatment.

 

In synthetic biology compared with classical biological technology, it is easy to find the common use of biological systems for the benefit of humanity. Both belong to the classic gene industrial biotechnology is often a single gene cloning and expression of foreign aid, and pay more attention to synthetic biology biological synthesis and assembly design, large-scale genome, usually on gene network editor, chassis cells, and made with biological intelligence. So out of the classical synthetic biology biotechnology "the limits of an industry", realize the biological, polygenic synergy; Complete synthesis of vaccines and drugs, accurate cell therapy, and so on.

 

Then, Professor Zhang introduced the development status of synthetic biology in China. From the statistics of synthetic biology papers in various countries, the number of reviews and highly cited articles in China has greatly increased from 2012 to 2022. In the future, Chinese enterprises need to make progress together with basic research and participate in the research process and the transformation of research results promptly through cooperation, so that the results of basic research can be transformed into powerful productivity.

 

Finally, the professor introduced the competition situation of iGEM in China. Teams from China account for forty-six percent of the number of MEDALS and account for forty-eight percent of the gold medal, the Chinese students' enthusiasm for synthetic biology. In 2022, China launched the first synthetic biology competition (innovation) SynBio Challenges attracted more than 80 teams to compete online. Online hits 4.213 million, related terms so reading quantity of more than 7.326 million. Sc competition with the iGEM competition actively cooperation, hope can realize double drive the growth of the young people.
